<h1>The Many Uses of Passive Acoustic Monitoring</h1>
<a href = "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data"> Passive acoustic monitoring:</a> a non-invasive, cost-effective, and long-term means of data collection. PAM is used to record and study biological, geological, and anthropogenic sound sources. Recorders can be placed both underwater and terrestrially, allowing for a wide variety of data to be collected and analyzed, and of course a variety of scientific questions to be studied and answered.

<p style = font-size:20px>Monitoring piping plover <em>(Charadrius melodus)</em> nesting sites</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Call types were classified by recording vocalizations and behaviors. A variety of call types were recorded, each broadly being used in the context of alarms or maintaining contact.</li>
        <li>Recordings were continuous during the nesting season. Classified calls during field observations were used to monitor rates of each call type.</li>
        <li>Call rates, of each call type, were plotted before, during, and after aircraft noise to determine if piping plovers were more likely to utter a specific type of call (alarm or contact) during the anthropgoenic noise, or reduce calling rates all together.</li>
    </ul>

<p style = font-size:20px>Monitoring of aircraft noise at piping plover <em>(Charadrius melodus)</em> nesting sites</p>

        <li>Piping plovers that nest on Long Island beaches are subject to constant aircraft noise, typically in the form of commuters flying between Manhattan and the Hamptons, or advertistment planes flying over beachgoers. Flight paths overlap with suitable nesting habitat. Aircraft noise was recorded for each aircraft type seen, leading to three broad classifcations: helicopter, prop plane, and jet plane. Field classifications allowed for later spectrogram analysis, leading to counts of each aircraft type recorded at each nesting site.</li>
