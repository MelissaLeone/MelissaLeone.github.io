<h1>The Many Uses of Passive Acoustic Monitoring</h1>
Passive acoustic monitoring <a href = "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data">(PAM)</a> is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and long-term means of data collection. PAM is used to record and study biological, geological, and anthropogenic sound sources. User-programmed duty cycles and sample rates are used to target specific sound sources, or study the soundscape of a specific environment. Recorders can be placed both underwater and terrestrially, allowing for a wide variety of data to be collected and analyzed, along with a plethora of scientific questions to be explored.

<h3><em>Acoustic monitoring of artificial reefs reveals Atlantic cod and weakfish spawning and presence of individual bottlenose dolphins</em></h3>
Abstract: The artificial reefs in New Yorkâ€™s waters provide structure in areas that are typically flat and sandy, creating habitat for a multitude of species as an area to spawn, forage, and reside. Passive acoustic data collected on the Fire Island and Shinnecock artificial reefs between 2018 and 2022 detected spawning-associated calls of weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), as well as the presence of individual bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops trun- catus) through their signature whistles. Weakfish and Atlantic cod were more vocally active on the Fire Island reef, where Atlantic cod grunts peaked during a new moon phase in December, and weakfish spawning experienced vari- able peaks between mid-July and mid-August on both reefs. Fifty-seven individual bottlenose dolphins were identi- fied, with whistle repeats ranging from seconds to years apart. Passive acoustic monitoring allows for simultaneous collection of information on multiple species at different trophic levels as well as behavioral information that helps managers understand how these animals utilize these habitats, which can lead to improved conservation measures (Leone & Warren, 2024).

<h3>Vessels and aircraft are chronic sources of anthropogenic noise in coastal marine and terrestrial soundscapes on Long Island, New York</h3>
Abstract: Passive acoustic data collected during 2020 and 2021 were used to monitor changes in both terrestrial and underwater soundscapes, as well as human activity from aircraft and vessels. Passive acoustic data were collected at two artificial reefs south of Long Island, as well as along ocean beaches in Southampton, NY. At the artificial reefs, vessel noise was recorded more frequently during 2020 than in 2021. Commercial vessels and multi-user charter fishing vessels were more abundant during 2020. Peaks in power spectral density occurred at 60, 90 and 120 Hz in 2020 and 2021, which are frequencies consistent with noise generated by commercial vessels, suggesting that vessels are a significant contributor to the soundscape of the artificial reefs. In the terrestrial environment, noise generated by aircraft was more common during 2021. Peaks in power spectral density were measured around 160 and 290 Hz at one of the ocean beach sites. These frequencies are consistent with noise generated by aircraft. This study documents the chronic extent of anthropogenic noise in both the underwater and terrestrial environments of Long Island, NY, as well as quantifies the occurrence of various noise sources in these habitats (Leone & Warren, 2024).

<p style = font-size:20px>Monitoring piping plover <em>(Charadrius melodus)</em> nesting sites</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Call types were classified by recording vocalizations and behaviors. A variety of call types were recorded, each broadly being used in the context of alarms or maintaining contact.</li>
        <li>Recordings were continuous during the nesting season. Classified calls during field observations were used to monitor rates of each call type.</li>
        <li>Call rates, of each call type, were plotted before, during, and after aircraft noise to determine if piping plovers were more likely to utter a specific type of call (alarm or contact) during the anthropgoenic noise, or reduce calling rates all together.</li>
    </ul>

<p style = font-size:20px>Monitoring of aircraft noise at piping plover <em>(Charadrius melodus)</em> nesting sites</p>

        <li>Piping plovers that nest on Long Island beaches are subject to constant aircraft noise, typically in the form of commuters flying between Manhattan and the Hamptons, or advertistment planes flying over beachgoers. Flight paths overlap with suitable nesting habitat. Aircraft noise was recorded for each aircraft type seen, leading to three broad classifcations: helicopter, prop plane, and jet plane. Field classifications allowed for later spectrogram analysis, leading to counts of each aircraft type recorded at each nesting site.</li>
